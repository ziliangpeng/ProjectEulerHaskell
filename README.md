Project Euler Solution in Haskell

This project is the result of my pratice on Haskell. I believe solving problems on Project Euler in Haskell is a great way to practice the language, and I try to write the program as minimal and elegant as possible. However, knowing that it is not encouraged to publish solution (or code) in the public, I will only attempt to solve problems that have been solved by at least 10,000 people. I hope this project can serve as a guide to beginners (both algorithms and Haskell), while not leaking solution to HARD problems.

if your have more elegant solution to a problem, pull request is welcome.

## Usage:

To run a particular problem $pid, run:

    ./run.sh $pid

for example:

    ./run.sh 1

To lock the answer for a problem $pid, run:

    ./lock_ans.sh $pid

for example:

    ./lock_ans.sh 1
